## About  

I grew up in the heart of Italian alps in the small city of Aosta, in the Aosta Valley. Since its strategic position, very close to both French and Swiss border, the Aosta Valley is a bilingual region. Therefore, we are used to grow up studying both French and Italian since the elementary school. This chance of speaking, since very young, two languages as a mother tongue, in addition to English, turned out to be a huge resource when traveling in the more recent years. All along my childhood I have been doing any kind of sports, living in this tiny, cozy, city which, for me, is still one of the most beautiful spot you could find in the whole earth. I lived there until I got my High School degree in Sciences in 2012.   

Afterwards, I moved to Turin where I started my studies at the faculty of Physics. I ended my Bachelor 3 years later and I straightaway started with my Master’s Degree in Complex System Physics. It was the end of 2015. After a year and a half I finished my exams and I left Italy towards Stockholm, Sweden. I spent 6 whole months at [Nordita](https://www.nordita.org), the Nordic institute for Theoretical Physics, as a guest master researcher working on my master thesis in the field of Brownian motion and Stochastic Thermodynamics.   
I finally defended my thesis in Turin in the end of October 2017 and got my Master’s Degree with honors.  

Arthur Schopenhauer once said:  

> Restlessness is the hallmark of existence.  

Therefore, I didn’t take any rest and I immediately got a position as a PhD student in the Machine Learning LAB at the Technische Universität in Berlin. Here, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Klaus-Robert Müller, I am mainly working in the field of Deep Learning as a tool to investigate the microscopic world of molecules and atoms.
