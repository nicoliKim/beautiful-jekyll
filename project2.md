I am proud to be a former member of the Liverbird team, working hard to “help the bird to take the fly”. 
My task at LiveBird is to provide a regular consultancy service to the company concerning the development and improvement of their platform through which they offer their service to customers. 
More in details, my work is about the development of performant and optimised algorithms as well as Machine Learning tools.
